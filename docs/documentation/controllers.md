# Customizing controllers

By default, Releaf controllers automatically have Index, Create, Edit and Destroy actions working out of the box.

All aspects of the default functionality can be fully customized, extended or disabled.

This chapter describes the general principles of working with the default actions:

* [Index action](controllers/index.html)
* [Create and Edit actions](controllers/edit.html)
* [Destroy action](controllers/destroy.html)
* [Disabling default actions](controllers/features.html)
* [Adding custom actions](controllers/custom-actions.html)

Further interface customizations for each action are described in the [Customizing views](views.html) chapter.
