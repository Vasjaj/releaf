RELEAF HTML OUTLINE:
html
    body

            = releaf logo, user box etc
        aside
            nav

[content]:

INDEX ACTION:

        = extras: search form etc
    section
        header (black)

        .body
            = table
        footer
            = pagination
            = footer extras (export import etc)

EDIT ACTION:
    header
        nav
            = breadcrumbs
        = extras: custom notices (above the black header), extra forms etc
    section
        form        -- form as an extra wrapper. not styled via css
            header (black)
                h1 = main title
                = toolbox
            .body

                fieldset                    - "belongs to" scenario or custom grouping of fields with only title + fields
                    legend = fieldset title - if there are still problems styling legend with css, h2 can be used here
                    .field
                    .field
                section                     - custom grouping of fields when the block needs to be separated from others and have its own header
                    header (black)
                        h1 = block title
                        = custom block header extras (toolboxes etc)
                    .body
                        fieldset
                            .field

                    footer (optional)
                        = block extra buttons etc
                section.type-nested         - multiple item blocks
                    header (non-black)
                        h1 = nested items title
                        = custom nested header extras
                    .body.list
                        fieldset.item
                            .field
                            .field
                            fieldset
                                < same as "belongs to" above >
                            section
                                < same as custom grouping above >
                            section.type-nested
                                < RECURSION >
                        fieldset.item
                            ...
                    footer
                        = add item
                        = custom nested footer extras
            footer
                = save button


DIALOG ACTION:
    full page render view for all dialogs.

    normally each dialog should have its own action with its own URL
    that renders a full page view from given params (and works via direct link also)

    ajax then fetches the content, picks out the dialog part and displays in ajaxbox
    that way there is no need to figure out custom techniques of storing the dialog template html somewhere within the main view etc

    header
        nav
            (breadcrumbs)
  --------------------------------------  (this block is used by ajax dialogs)
  | section.dialog
  |     form  (optional - if the dialog is not a single form, this wrapper does not exist)
  |         header (black) (optional)
  |             h1 = dialog title
  |             = close button
  |         .body
  |             = dialog content
  |         footer                         -- in other full page views this footer would sit at the bottom of the page/window
  |             = ok / cancel et              but inside a section.dialog it is displayed immediately after the .body
  ----------------------------------------


CUSTOM ACTIONS:

    header
        nav
            (breadcrumbs)
        = custom header stuff
    section
        header (black)
            = h1
            = custom header
        .body
            = custom content
        footer
            = custom page footer

=================================================================

in all section levels the same structural pattern is repeated:

    section
        header
        .body
        footer

if the whole section is a form, then the form is an extra wrapper

    section
        form
            header
            .body
            footer

=================================================================

CSS:

/*
    to avoid adding additional class names in html, 2 versions of selectors are needed - both with and without there being a form wrapper
    which is not ideal, but is needed for section nesting to work
    because an immediate child selector is needed so as not to affect any nested sections
*/

section:not(.type-nested) > header,   /* better to use :not(), so that further section.type-nested > header does not have to undo all this */
section > form > header
{
    black
}

section:not(.type-nested) > .body,
section > form > .body
{
    border
}

fieldset
{
    no border
}

/*
    nested sections will not have their own forms, therefore a single selector is enough
*/
section.type-nested > header
{
    not black
}

section.type-nested > .body
{
    no border
}

section.type-nested > .body > .item    /* in nested item sections the borders are on the fieldsets/items instead of .body */
{
    border
}

/*
    with this structure we can also get rid of .view-* prefixes
    so that the styles work in any view

    and the default selectors will be weaker -> easier to override

    current selectors like
    .view-edit form .section .field
    will become
    .field
