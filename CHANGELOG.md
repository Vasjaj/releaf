  ```

  ```ruby
    field_type_name = Releaf::TemplateFieldTypeMapper.field_type_name(resource, field_name)
    use_i18n = Releaf::TemplateFieldTypeMapper.use_i18n?(resource, field_name)
  ```
* created new helper method ```ajax?```. If you were checking
  ```params[:ajax]``` or ```params.has_key?(:ajax)``` etc, then you should
  update your code to use ```ajax?```.
